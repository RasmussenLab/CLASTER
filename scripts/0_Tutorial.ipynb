    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi! \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this small tutorial on how to build and run CLASTER using the EIR framework. Please clone this repository (CLASTER) on your computer to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About CLASTER\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chromatin Landscape and Structure Expression Regressor (CLASTER) is a deep convolutional neural network aimed to translate a given chromatin landscape and its matching 3D structure to the corresponding nascent RNA landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/Claster_image.png\" alt=\"Claster image\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1. Network overview.** *Chromatin landscape information is provided as ATAC-seq, H3K4me3 (promoter), H3K27ac (enhancer) and H3K27me3 (silencer) enrichment levels for a region of 1Mbp at a resolution of 100bp. Chromatin structure is provided as a Micro-C map matching the genomic region covered by the other branch of the model at a resolution of 1600kbp. A set of convolutions extract features from both branches separately, then these features are combined in a set of fully connected layers (MLP) and finally used to predict the nascent transcription profiles (measured by EU-seq) at a kbp resolution.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The network takes as inputs two matrices describing the chromatin landscape in a region of 1 Mbp and the matching Micro-C map describing the contact frequency between different loci in this region.\n",
    "1) The chromatin landscape is described by a matrix of shape (4,10001) where we have the enrichment of ATAC-seq, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 in bins of 100bp exploring 1Mbp of genomic context.\n",
    "2) Micro-C contact maps explore the same region at a resolution of 1600 bp.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network:**\n",
    "The network consists of:\n",
    "- **Feature extractors**: two separate feature extractors with a number of convolutional layers implementing dilated convolutions and some residual connections. \n",
    "    - The first one extracts patterns from the chromatin landscape, described by combinations of ATAC-seq, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 enrichments. \n",
    "    - The second one extracts features from the Micro-C maps (e.g. point-like contacts, compartments or domains).\n",
    "- **Fusion module**: The extracted high-level, abstract features are then combined in a number of dense layers.\n",
    "- **Output module**: A final set of dense layers maps the feature vectors to the targets in a regression task per node, which will represent the EU-seq signal at a distance from the TSS of the gene defining the sample (located in the middle).\n",
    "\n",
    "CLASTER was built using the EIR framework, a python package developed by Arnor Sigurdsson ([arnor.sigurdsson@sund.ku.dk](mailto:arnor.sigurdsson@sund.ku.dk)) which makes it easy to replicate and adapt it to new tasks. Documentation on EIR can be found at [eir.readthedocs.io](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Have a look at the tutorials to get a feel for the config files required and all possibilities that EIR offers. The framework uses hydra (https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) to manage a set of configuration files, which allow you to streamline the process."

    "CLASTER was designed to predict nascent transcription, but the EIR framework can be reused and expanded for any other purpose. It can handle plenty of other data modalities as well! You just need a well defined input containing some information or signal that can be used to infer the values of another, as an output. You can then customize your network using EIR, provide the inputs and targets in one of the supported data modalities, and name samples with the same ID for input and output.\n",
